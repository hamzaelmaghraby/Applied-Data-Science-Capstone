# Rocket First Stage Recovery Predictor

## Overview

The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model for assessing the likelihood of successful recovery and reuse of the first stage in our rocket launches. Leveraging data from SpaceX Falcon 9 launches, the project aims to analyze various factors influencing the outcome of first stage landings. By employing data science techniques, including statistical analysis and machine learning algorithms, we intend to identify patterns and correlations within the data that can help predict the success of first stage recovery efforts. This predictive capability is crucial for optimizing the cost-effectiveness and sustainability of our rocket launches.

The project will involve gathering and preprocessing relevant data from SpaceX Falcon 9 launches, including flight telemetry, environmental conditions, mission parameters, and historical landing outcomes. Subsequently, we will develop and train machine learning models on this data to forecast the likelihood of first stage recovery success. The successful completion of this project will enable us to make informed decisions regarding launch operations, resource allocation, optimizing the cost-effectiveness and sustainability of our rocket launches, and risk management, ultimately enhancing the efficiency and competitiveness of our rocket launch endeavors.

## Data Collection

### Data Sources:

- **SpaceX REST API**: We will gather SpaceX launch data from the SpaceX REST API. This API provides comprehensive information about launches.
- **Web Scraping Wiki Pages**: Additionally, we will employ web scraping techniques to extract Falcon 9 launch data from related Wiki pages.

## Data Wrangling

Data wrangling, also known as data munging, is the process of transforming and cleaning raw data into a structured format suitable for analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### EDA with Data Visualization

Visualizing the data through graphs and charts to gain insights into various factors affecting first stage recovery success.

### EDA with SQL

Performing exploratory data analysis using SQL queries to extract meaningful information from the dataset.

## Interactive Visualization

Building an interactive map with Folium to visualize the geographical distribution of successful and unsuccessful first stage landings.

## Dashboard Development

Building a dashboard with Plotly Dash to provide a user-friendly interface for exploring the analysis results and predictions.

## Predictive Analysis

Utilizing various classification algorithms including KNN, SVM, classification tree, and logistic regression to predict the likelihood of first stage recovery success based on the gathered data.
